<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Share capital and variation of rights</b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any existing shares or class of shares but subject to the Act, shares in the company may be issued by the directors and any such shares may be issued with such preferred, deferred, or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital, or otherwise, as the directors, subject to any ordinary resolution of the company, determine.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Subject to the Act, any preference shares may, with the sanction of an ordinary resolution, be issued on the terms that they are, or at the option of the company are liable, to be redeemed.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of 75% of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class. To every such separate general meeting the provisions of these Regulations relating to general meetings shall with the necessary modifications apply, but so that the necessary quorum shall be 2 persons at least holding or representing by proxy one-third of the issued shares of the class and that any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll. To every such special resolution section 184 shall with such adaptations as are necessary apply.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking equally therewith.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may exercise the powers of paying commissions conferred by the Act, provided that the rate per cent or the amount of the commission paid or agreed to be paid shall be disclosed in the manner required by the Act and the commission shall not exceed the rate of 10% of the price at which the shares in respect whereof the same is paid are issued or an amount equal to 10% of that price (as the case may be). Such commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in one way and partly in the other. The company may also on any issue of shares pay such brokerage as may be lawful.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the company as holding any share upon any trust, and the company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or unit of a share or (except only as by these Regulations or by law otherwise provided) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register of members shall be entitled without payment to receive a certificate under the seal of the company in accordance with the Act but in respect of a share or shares held jointly by several persons the company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for a share to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.</numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Lien</b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>The company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all money (whether presently payable or not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share, and the company shall also have a first and paramount lien on all shares (other than fully paid shares) registered in the name of a single person for all money presently payable by him or his estate to the company; but the directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this regulation. The company's lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable thereon.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The company may sell, in such manner as the directors think fit, any shares on which the company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, nor until the expiration of 14 days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the share, or the person entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>To give effect to any such sale the directors may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer, and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The proceeds of the sale shall be received by the company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, and the residue, if any, shall (subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.</numbered_1_para>
<b_left_sidehead_nonum>Calls on shares</b_left_sidehead_nonum>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of any money unpaid on their shares and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times, provided that no call shall be payable at less than one month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call, and each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 days' notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the directors may determine.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the directors authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate not exceeding 8% per annum as the directors may determine, but the directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of that interest wholly or in part.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date shall for the purposes of these Regulations be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the same becomes payable, and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of these Regulations as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture, or otherwise shall apply as if the sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may, on the issue of shares, differentiate between the holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment.</numbered_1_para>
<numbered_1_para>The directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any part of the money uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any part of the money so advanced may (until the same would, but for the advance, become payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding (unless the company in general meeting shall otherwise direct) 8% per annum as may be agreed upon between the directors and the member paying the sum in advance.</numbered_1_para>
