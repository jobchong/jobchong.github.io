    <para_5>(a)	a merger or consolidation in which (i) the Corporation is a constituent party or (ii) a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation, except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for equity securities that represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, at least a majority, by voting power, of the equity securities of (1) the surviving or resulting party or (2) if the surviving or resulting party is a wholly owned subsidiary of another party immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent of such surviving or resulting party; provided that, for the purpose of this Section, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of options outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation or upon conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined below) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable, deemed to be converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged; or

The value of such property, rights or securities shall be determined in good faith by the Board.</para_4_firstbold>
    <para_2_firstbold>Voting.</para_2_firstbold>
    <para_3_firstbold>General. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock may cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter.  Fractional votes shall not be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred stock held by each holder could be converted) will be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).  Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of this Restated Certificate, holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision of this Restated Certificate, to notice of any stockholder meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.</para_3_firstbold>

At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the class, classes, or series entitled to elect the director constitutes a quorum for the purpose of electing the director.</para_3_firstbold>
    <para_3_firstbold xname="stockprotection">Preferred Stock Protective Provisions.  At any time when at least 25% of the initially issued shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not, either directly or indirectly by amendment, merger, consolidation or otherwise, do any of the following without (in addition to any other vote required by law or the Restated Certificate) the written consent or affirmative vote of the Requisite Holders, given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting, or voting (as the case may be) separately as a single class:</para_3_firstbold>
    <para_4>alter the rights, powers or privileges of the Preferred Stock set forth in the Restated Certificate or Bylaws, as then in effect, in a way that adversely affects the Preferred Stock;</para_4>
    <para_4>increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of any class or series of capital stock;</para_4>
    <para_4>authorize or create (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of capital stock having rights, powers, or privileges set forth in the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as then in effect, that are senior to or on a parity with any series of Preferred Stock;</para_4>
    <para_4>redeem or repurchase any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (other than pursuant to employee or consultant agreements giving the Corporation the right to repurchase shares upon the termina¬tion of services pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement);</para_4>
    <para_4>declare or pay any dividend or otherwise make a distribution to holders of Preferred Stock or Common Stock; </para_4>

    <para_3_firstbold>Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock have the following conversion rights (the <b><i>“Conversion Rights”</i></b>):</para_3_firstbold>
    <para_4_firstbold>Right to Convert.</para_4_firstbold>
    <para_5_firstbold>Conversion Ratio. Each share of Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for that series of Preferred Stock in effect at the time of conversion.  The <b><i>“Conversion Price”</b></i> for each series of Preferred Stock means the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock, which initial Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, is subject to adjustment as provided in this Restated Certificate.</para_5_firstbold>
    <para_5_firstbold>Termination of Conversion Rights.  Subject to Section <xref to="conversionnotice"> in the case of a Contingency Event herein, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights will terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the first payment of any funds and assets distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.</para_5_firstbold>
    <para_4_firstbold xname="fractional">Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock.  In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board.  Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion will be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.</para_4_firstbold>
    <para_4_firstbold>Mechanics of Conversion.</para_4_firstbold>
    <para_5_firstbold xname="conversionnotice">Notice of Conversion.  To voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, a holder of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that the holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Pre¬ferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which the conversion is contingent (a <b><i>“Contingency Event”</i></b>).  The conversion notice must state the holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.  If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of trans¬fer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.  The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of the certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or, if later, the date on which all Contingency Events have occurred) will be the time of conversion (the <b><i>“Conversion Time”</i></b>), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such time.  The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (a) issue and deliver to the holder, or to the holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion in accordance with the provisions of this Restated Certificate and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section <xref to="fractional"> in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (c) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.</para_5_firstbold>
    <para_5_firstbold>Reservation of Shares.  For the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall at all times while any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, that number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as may from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock is not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such corporate action to be taken as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.  Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock below the then-par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take any corporate action that may be necessary so that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.</para_5_firstbold>
    <para_5_firstbold>Effect of Conversion.  All shares of Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion as provided in this Restated Certificate shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares will immediately cease and terminate at the Conver¬sion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section <xref to="fractional">, and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.  Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued.</para_5_firstbold>
    <para_5_firstbold>No Further Adjustment.  Upon any conversion of shares of Pre-ferred Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock will be made with respect to the converted shares for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.</para_5_firstbold>
