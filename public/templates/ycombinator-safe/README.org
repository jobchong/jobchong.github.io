* History
Around 2015-02-13, Michael Cho first paid to get the SAFE translated for Singapore

Meng then went back to the original SAFE and re-translated it for Singapore

The Legalese team then reviewed Michael's SAFE, added useful bits, and overloaded the SAFE with all four flavours in one document.
