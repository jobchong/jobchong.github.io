Section 1
Right of First Refusal
Right of First Refusal to Significant Holders.  The Company hereby grants to each Investor who owns at least [___________] Shares or shares of the Company’s Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares (the “Conversion Stock”) (as presently constituted and subject to subsequent adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits and the like) (the “Significant Holders”), the right of first refusal to purchase its pro rata share of New Securities (as defined in this Section 1.1(a)) which the Company may, from time to time, propose to sell and issue after the date of this Agreement.  A Significant Holder’s pro rata share, for purposes of this right of first refusal, is equal to the ratio of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock owned by such Significant Holder immediately prior to the issuance of New Securities (assuming full conversion of the Shares and exercise of all outstanding convertible securities, rights, options and warrants, directly or indirectly, into Common Stock held by said Significant Holder) to (b) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of New Securities (assuming full conversion of the Shares and exercise of all outstanding convertible securities, rights, options and warrants, directly or indirectly, held by all of the Significant Holders).
(a)	“New Securities” shall mean any capital stock (including Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock) of the Company whether now authorized or not, and rights, convertible securities, options or warrants to purchase such capital stock, and securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, exercisable or convertible into capital stock; provided that the term “New Securities” does not include:
(i)	the Shares and the Conversion Stock; 
(ii)	up to [___________] (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, stock splits, recapitalizations and the like) securities issued or issuable to officers, employees, directors, consultants, placement agents, and other service providers of the Company (or any subsidiary) pursuant to stock grants, option plans, purchase plans, agreements or other employee stock incentive programs or arrangements approved by the Board of Directors of the Company; 
(iii)	securities issued pursuant to the conversion or exercise of warrants or any outstanding convertible or exercisable securities as of this date of this Agreement; 
(iv)	securities issued or issuable as a dividend or distribution on Preferred Stock of the Company or pursuant to any event for which adjustment is made pursuant to paragraph 3(d), 3(e) or 3(f) of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company;
(v)	securities offered pursuant to a bona fide, firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act;
(vi)	securities issued or issuable pursuant to the acquisition of another corporation by the Company by merger, purchase of substantially all of the assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement, provided, that such issuances are approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;
(vii)	securities issued or issuable to banks, equipment lessors or other financial institutions pursuant to a commercial leasing or debt financing transaction approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;
(viii)	securities issued or issuable in connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or strategic partnerships approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;
(ix)	securities issued to suppliers or third party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions approved by the Board of Directors of the Company;
(x)	securities of the Company which are otherwise excluded by the affirmative unanimous vote of the Board of Directors of the Company; and
(xi)	any right, option or warrant to acquire any security convertible into the securities excluded from the definition of New Securities pursuant to subsections (i) through (x) above.
(b)	In the event the Company proposes to undertake an issuance of New Securities, it shall give each Significant Holder written notice of its intention, describing the type of New Securities, and their price and the general terms upon which the Company proposes to issue the same.  Each Significant Holder shall have ten (10) calendar days after any such notice is mailed or delivered to agree to purchase such Holder’s pro rata share of such New Securities for the price and upon the terms specified in the notice by giving written notice to the Company, in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 1, and stating therein the quantity of New Securities to be purchased.
(c)	In the event the Significant Holders fail to exercise fully the right of first refusal within said ten (10) day period (the “Election Period”), the Company shall have ninety (90) days thereafter to sell or enter into an agreement (pursuant to which the sale of New Securities covered thereby shall be closed, if at all, within ninety (90) days from the date of said agreement) to sell that portion of the New Securities with respect to which the Significant Holders’ right of first refusal option set forth in this Section 1.1 was not exercised, at a price and upon terms no more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the Company’s notice to Significant Holders delivered pursuant to Section 1.1(b).  In the event the Company has not sold within such ninety (90) day period following the Election Period, or such ninety (90) day period following the date of said agreement, the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any New Securities, without first again offering such securities to the Significant Holders in the manner provided in this Section 1.1.
(d)	The right of first refusal granted under this Agreement shall expire upon, and shall not be applicable to the first to occur of (x) the Company’s Initial Public Offering or (y) five years after the date of this Agreement.
Section 2
Covenants of the Company
The Company hereby covenants and agrees, as follows:

Restrictions on Transfer
Restrictions on Transfer
(a)	The holder of each notice of issuance referencing the Securities, or certificate evidencing the Securities (as defined below) (a “Holder”) by acceptance thereof agrees to comply in all respects with the provisions of this Section 3.1.  Each Holder agrees not to make any sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of all or any portion of the Securities, or any beneficial interest therein, unless and until (i) the transferee thereof has agreed in writing for the benefit of the Company to take and hold such Securities subject to, and to be bound by, the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 3.1 and Section 3.3, except for transfers permitted under Section 3.1(b), and (ii) such Holder shall have given prior written notice to the Company of such Holder’s intention to make such disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed description of the manner and circumstances of the proposed disposition, and, if requested by the Company, such Holder shall have furnished the Company, at its expense, with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
(b)	Permitted transfers include (i) a transfer not involving a change in beneficial ownership, or (ii) in transactions involving the distribution without consideration of Securities by any Holder to (x) a parent, subsidiary or other affiliate of Holder that is a corporation or (y) any of its partners, members or other equity owners, or retired partners, retired members or other equity owners, or to the estate of any of its partners, members or other equity owners or retired partners, retired members or other equity owners, or (iii) transfers in compliance with Rule 144(k), as long as the Company is furnished with satisfactory evidence of compliance with such Rule; provided, in each case, that the Holder thereof shall give written notice to the Company of such Holder’s intention to effect such disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed description of the manner and circumstances of the proposed disposition.
(c)	Each notice of issuance referencing the Securities, or certificate evidencing the Securities shall (unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of this Agreement) bear a legend substantially similar to the following (in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws):
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM. THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.
THE SHARES REFERENCED HEREIN OR REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE, INCLUDING A LOCK-UP PERIOD IN THE EVENT OF A PUBLIC OFFERING, AS SET FORTH IN AN INVESTORS’ RIGHTS AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE COMPANY.
The Holders consent to the Company making a notation on its records and giving instructions to any transfer agent of the Securities in order to implement the restrictions on transfer established in this Section 3.1.
(d)	The first legend referring to federal and state securities laws identified in Section 3.1(c) above, and the stock transfer instructions and record notations with respect to such Securities, will be removed and the Company will deliver a notice of issuance referencing the Securities, or shall issue a certificate evidencing the Securities, without such legend to the holder of such Securities if (i) such securities are registered under the Securities Act, or (ii) such holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such securities may be made without registration under the Securities Act, or (iii) such holder provides the Company with reasonable assurances, which may, at the option of the Company, include an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, that such securities can be sold pursuant to Section (k) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
Rule 144 Reporting.  With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit the sale of the Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:
(e)	Make and keep public information regarding the Company available as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times from and after ninety (90) days following the effective date of the first registration under the Securities Act filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the general public; 
(f)	File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements; and
(g)	So long as a Holder owns any Securities, furnish to the Holder forthwith upon written request a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 (at any time from and after ninety (90) days following the effective date of the first registration statement filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the general public), and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed as a Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing a Holder to sell any such securities without registration.
Market Stand-Off Agreement. Each Holder hereby agrees that such Holder shall not sell or otherwise transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale, of any Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company held by such Holder (other than those included in the registration) during the one hundred eighty (180) day period following the effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act (or such other period as may be requested by the Company or an underwriter to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (i) the publication or other distribution of research reports and (ii) analyst recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to, the restrictions contained in NASD Rule 2711(f)(4) or NYSE Rule 472(f)(4), or any successor provisions or amendments thereto), provided that: all officers and directors of the Company and holders of at least one percent (1%) of the Company’s voting securities are bound by and have entered into similar agreements. The obligations described in this Section 3.3 shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-l or Form S-8 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration relating solely to a transaction on Form S-4 or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future.  The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions and may reference the second legend set forth in Section 4.1(c) hereof within the notice of issuance or on the certificate evidencing the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of such one hundred eighty (180) day (or other) period.  Each Holder agrees to execute a market standoff agreement with said underwriters in customary form consistent with the provisions of this Section 3.3.
