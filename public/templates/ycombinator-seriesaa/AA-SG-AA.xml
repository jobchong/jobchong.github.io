<numbered_3_firstbold xname="ycaa_issuesoc">Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common. In the event the Corporation after the date of the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities or, in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options and the conversion or exchange of the underlying securities, shall be deemed to have been issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which shares are deemed to be issued:</numbered_3_firstbold>

<numbered_4_para_fltab>upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price of each Series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) and any subsequent adjustments based thereon shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:</numbered_4_para_fltab>

<numbered_5_para>in the case of Convertible Securities or Options for Common Stock, the only Additional Shares of Common issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options plus the consideration actually received by the Corporation upon such exercise or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange, and</numbered_5_para>

<numbered_5_para>in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of such exercised Options, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section <xref to="ycaa_consideration" />) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised; and</numbered_5_para>

In the event this Corporation shall issue Additional Shares of Common (including Additional Shares of Common deemed to be issued pursuant to paragraph <xref to="ycaa_issuesoc" />) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the applicable Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then, the Conversion Price of the Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total number of Additional Shares of Common so issued would purchase at such Conversion Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares of Common so issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be reduced at such time if the amount of such reduction would be less than $0.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward, and a reduction will be made with respect to such amount at the time of, and together with, any subsequent reduction which, together with such amount and any other amounts so carried forward, equal $0.01 or more in the aggregate.

<numbered_5_para>in the event Additional Shares of Common are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (a) and (b) above, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.</numbered_5_para>

<numbered_4_para_fltab>Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common deemed to have been issued pursuant to paragraph <xref to="ycaa_issuesoc" /> shall be determined by dividing</numbered_4_para_fltab>

<numbered_5_para>the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by</numbered_5_para>

In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.</numbered_2_firstbold>

<numbered_2_firstbold>Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock.

In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.</numbered_2_firstbold>

<numbered_2_firstbold>Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution.  Subject to Section 2 above (“Liquidation Rights”), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive, each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.</numbered_2_firstbold>

<numbered_2_firstbold xname="ycaa_adjustments">Certificate as to Adjustments.  Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.

<numbered_3_firstbold>Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion.  The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.</numbered_3_firstbold>
